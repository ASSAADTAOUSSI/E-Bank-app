📌 E-Bank-app

E-Bank-app is a full-stack electronic banking web application designed to simulate core online banking features. This project provides users with essential banking functionalities such as secure authentication, account overview, and transaction processing through a modern, responsive user interface.

🔍 Project Overview

The application is structured as a real-world banking platform with clearly separated frontend, backend, and infrastructure components. It demonstrates common architectural patterns used in web development and financial applications:

Frontend: Implements the client-side user interface for customers to interact with the banking system.

Backend: Provides RESTful APIs to handle business logic such as user authentication, profile management, account transactions, and data persistence.

Orchestration: Uses docker-compose.yml to streamline running multiple services locally for development and testing.

🛠️ Key Features

✔ User registration and login
✔ Secure session management
✔ Dashboard with account info
✔ Transaction history and operations
✔ Modular frontend + backend separation
✔ Containerized development setup with Docker

(Customize the above list to reflect exact features in your app.)

🚀 Tech Stack

Typical technologies used in projects like this include:
✔ JavaScript / TypeScript
✔ Frontend frameworks/libraries (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue)
✔ Backend (Node.js / Spring Boot / Java / Express)
✔ REST APIs
✔ Relational/NoSQL database
✔ Docker for local deployment

(If your app uses specific tech, replace the generic ones above.)
